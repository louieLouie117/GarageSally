Today I was able to get the registration and login working. I made the registration a two-step single form for a better user experience.  I still need to make the registration and login mobile. I also was able to work on the dashboard and set up all the partials that will be working on in the dashboard.

Today I started version 1.6. There was a lot done for version 1.5 and you can review Trello for all the task that was completed. There were some very big wins in v1.5 that I would like to highlight.

Today we started version 1.7 and wanted to go over some highlights for version 1.6. In version 1.6 I was able to get the photo uploader handler working. I also add a description filled in the model. I notice how important for every garage sale to have a description when I went to a community garage sale.
