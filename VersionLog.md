I was able to render the overview partial menu that is only shown to the Admin users. I do have a concern if this is going to affect the client-server since I updated a model. I do believe since this model does not have a relationship with models it show have no effect. I will reach at to Kimberly to confirm.

Today I was able to update the index page search function. I was able to filter out the past due to sales. Filtering past due dates allows me to render the notification for users to sign up for email notifications.
